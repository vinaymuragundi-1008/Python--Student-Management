**📘 Student Management System(Python Project)**

**📌Project Overview**

The Student Management System is a Python-based application designed to efficiently manage student academic records and generate meaningful insights from the data. The system allows users to perform complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student records stored in a CSV file, making it a lightweight yet powerful data management solution.

Built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project not only handles student data but also performs statistical analysis and produces visual reports such as marks distribution, attendance patterns, course-wise averages, and performance correlations. These insights help understand overall academic trends and identify top-performing as well as low-performing students.

**⭐ What This Project Demonstrates**
